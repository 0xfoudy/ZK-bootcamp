## P vs NP Problem

Watch the following videos to get an intuition for what the P vs NP problem is:

In addition to the homeworks linked in the tutorials above, please do the following problem set.

For the questions that ask you to “show” something, we are not looking for a proof, just an explaination or argument why the statement is true.

The point of the exercise is for you to understand the problem, not to get marks on a test.

**Problem set (mandatory):**

1. Suppose you have a set {monyet, kodok, burung, ular}. Define a binary operator that turns it into a group using set-theoretic definitions

2. Find a binary operator that is closed but not associative for real numbers

3. Let our set be real numbers. Show a binary operator that is not closed

4 What algebraic structure is all odd integers under multiplication? All even integers under addition?

5 Let our group be 3 x 2 matrices of integers under addition. What is the identity and inverse? Can this be a cyclic group, why or why not? (Pay very close attention to the definition of cyclic group)

6 Demonstrate that

$$
n \pmod p, n=...-2,-1,0,1,2,...
$$

is a group under addition. Remember, you need to show that:

- the binary operator is closed
- the binary operator is associative
- an indentity exsits
- every element has an inverse

7 Demonstrate that

$$
g^{n} \pmod p, n=...-2, -1, 0, 1, 2...
$$

Where g and p are relatively prime is a group under multiplication. That is, given elements g^a, g^b, (g^a)*(g^b) is in the group and the binary operator follows the group laws.

8 Both integers and polynomials with integer coefficients are rings. It is possible to define a homomorphism from integers to polynomials and polynomials to integers, but it isn’t the same transformation.

Reviewing this material is optional, but if you like video lectures this may be helpful. Sometimes seeing the same information from two angles is helpful, so we provide good resources here.

### Abstract Algebra Lectures (Option 1)

This is a very good high level introduction

You do not need to watch the entire series, just videos 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11

### Abstract Algebra Lectures (Option 2)

If you prefer something a little more mid-level as opposed to high level, this is a good option

You do not need to watch the entire series, just videos 1-15
